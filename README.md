# Electronic-Circuit-Solver
With the help of a computer program consist of graph algorithm solving a electronic circuit

Abinav and I have developed a computational approach to electric circuit solving based on graph theory concepts. This will combine abstract mathematics, linear algebra, physics of circuits and computer programming to reach the goal of implementing automated circuit solver.

Graph theory plays many important roles, which span such diverse topics as the description of scale-free networks, up to the structure of the universe as a complex directed graph in causal set theory. Graph theory is also ideally suited to describe many concepts in computer science. 

Electrical networks are an important part of the standard engineering curriculum, specially for circuit branch students. Indeed, graph-theoretical concepts are at the very basis of many programs for the resolution of electrical and electronic circuits – like, e.g., SPICE – and here we describe a project to construct from scratch one such program.


Function like :

Matrix - Multiplication, substraction , inverse , adjoint , co-factor etc are designed and used

vector< vector<Double> >    :    2D array used in program
